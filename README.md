# This project is a small demo for a stock price chart (I don't know, whatever, I'm a finance idiot)

## I used my own starter kit, cause I am done with CRA(no config flexibility) and do not want to use Next or Gatsby(too many configs) 😂

## If anyone likes, just take my starter kit away 😏

#### I used D3 for this demo, I don't like it at all, to tell the truth

#### But I just learnt Canvas for less than 30min, can anyone tell me how to debug this stuff except for console.log??? 😩

#### not much choice, so just D3

1. npm install or yarn
2. npm run serve or npm run serve:win
3. [Demo address](https://optimistic-stonebraker-92c5fb.netlify.app/)
